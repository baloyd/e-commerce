# e-commerce

This project creates a database for an e-commerce website using models and routes through Sequelize.
The models create the skeleton for the tables to be used within the database including any specific parameters for each column and then the
seed files populate the appropriate tables and columns in a fast and efficient manner.
Through Postman we are able to demonstrate RESTful CRUD operations that the user can utilize to manipulate and control the database.

This image shows the different api calls used to access and manipulate the databases information:
